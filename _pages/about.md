About me
======
Before coming to University of Oklahoma(OU) for Masters, I had studied Bachelors degree from [BVBCET](https://www.kletech.ac.in/) for 4 years.Having worked in a lot of Team projects in Bachelor's degree and having completed them in a very appeasing manner I can say that I am a very good Team Player.

Apart from Coding, I love to enjoy life as it comes.

I like to be updated with the current technology. 

I follow [Marques Brownlee](https://www.youtube.com/user/marquesbrownlee) on YouTube to keep myself updated with the new technologies.

I follow [TheStraightPipes](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC86SBFIAgnYL3ll2ZDgmsuA) and [RedlineReviews](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2MrtVb1dT4FhcbOlW736kA) to get updates about new cars

I love talking about Tesla & Elon Musk.
