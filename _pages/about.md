## Research Interests
I am a graduate computer engineering student at the University of Oklahoma(OU). My current research focus is based on Database management systems in real-life scenarios.

I am currently working with the US Department of Agriculture as an IT Consultant from the position of Research Assistant at University of Oklahoma. I am helping them move from Books and Papers based database into Online based MySQL database. Using this database is helping them keep track of changes about the animals they experiment upon. It is also helping them to make new changes much more effectively because the researchers are not needed to spend a lot of time in entering the data and can spend more time on analyzing the data and continuing with the research. You can see the [website](livebarn.pythonanywhere.com) USDA-ARS is using to save their data into the database.
