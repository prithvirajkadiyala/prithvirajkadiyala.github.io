Last Project (Aug 2016-Dec 2018)
======
Web-based application for USDA to keep track of animals in their research labratories.
A live application can be seen [here](livebarn.pythonanywhere.com)

I was working with the US Department of Agriculture as an IT Consultant from the position of Research Assistant at University of Oklahoma. I am helping them move from Books and Papers based database into Online based MySQL database. Using this database is helping them keep track of changes about the animals they experiment upon. It is also helping them to make new changes much more effectively because the researchers are not needed to spend a lot of time in entering the data and can spend more time on analyzing the data and continuing with the research. You can see the [website](livebarn.pythonanywhere.com) USDA-ARS is using to save their data into the database.

* Designed and deployed a website while leading a team of 5  while improving the performance over existing application.
* Implemented multi-user functionality allowing for data exchange times between the animal scientists by ~100%.
* Implemented a search functionality with a radio checkbox to minimize the search radius to reduce load time by ~75%.
* Website hosted on remote Linux server using Apache framework to accommodate Flask applications.
* Implemented Python for redirection and handling server requests between JavaScript and RestAPIs in JSON format.
* Implemented RestAPIs for asynchronous server requests allowing multi-user functionality to function better.
* Responsible for translating the Scientists' requirements into Real-world features.
* Enhanced user experience by fine-tuning stored procedures & SQL queries for efficient data retrieval for ~1M records.
* Technologies Used: 
 
 JavaScript | AJAX | MySQL | HTML | Flask | Python | CSS | SQLite3 | REST-API
